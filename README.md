# vtPowerShell

I'm trying to figure out how to turn most of the essentail things that I do on a Verint/Telligent forum into scripts.

These may or may not ever see the light of day, but I figured I should put them *somewhere*.

I've never written a proper PowerShell Module before, so I'm starting the way I know - with functions to do the things I need.
